Slippage cannot be completely prevented, but its impact can be minimized in three ways:
1. Choose assets with high trading volume and liquidity.
2. Opt for transactions with smaller amounts that are more likely to execute, instead of large orders.
3. Set a slippage tolerance during price fluctuations, where slippage might exceed the predefined limit at the time of execution.
