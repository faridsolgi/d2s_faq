# What is Dex2swap?

Dex2swap is a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) and a cross-chain bridge aggregator. We find the best chain liquidity for seamless exchange of any asset. Our algorithm finds the best price across every DEX. We compare the prices from liquidity providers (LPs) with the best liquidity pools, split orders, and consider prices, slippages, and network fees.
