# Why do swaps sometimes not execute?

Swaps sometimes do not execute for several reasons:
1. Insufficient network fee: During network congestion, the costs, or so-called gas fees, might skyrocket. Miners prioritize transactions with higher gas fees, so if your transaction is not picked up by a miner for a long time, it can lead to the transaction not executing.
2. Excessive slippage: In unstable markets, liquidity depth can change. If the transaction amount is below the minimum required, it might halt the deal due to excessive slippage, leading to rejection or failure.
3. Duplicate transactions: If a user performs several identical transactions simultaneously but only has sufficient balance for the first transaction, subsequent transactions will be rejected.
