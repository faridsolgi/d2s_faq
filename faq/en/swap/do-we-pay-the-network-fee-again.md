# If we've paid the network fee but the transaction was not successful, do we need to pay the network fee again?

Yes, you need to pay the network fees again. When you send/transfer an asset, engage in contract interactions, or participate in activities occurring on the network, you need to pay network fees for miners or validators to process the transaction. Since miners or validators consume network resources in processing a transaction, whether successful or not, a network fee is required.
