# What is the difference between a swap and a cross-chain swap?

A swap refers to exchanging cryptocurrency within the same network, where both payment and receipt of tokens occur on that network. A cross-chain swap refers to exchanging assets across different networks, where the token you pay with and the token you receive are on different networks.
